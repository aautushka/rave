The goal is to implement a simple yet fast C++ state-machine. Writing boilerplate code is no fun, yet using the all-powerful Boost libraries (boost.statechart and boost.msm) may be an overkill in most applications. I usually resign to using the C-style switch-based state-machine, because it's fast, easy to debug, understand and reason about.
